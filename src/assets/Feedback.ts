Oleksandra Pavliuk",,"Adrien has a great understanding of our product and his attention to details is outstanding.
His willingness to take on challenging tasks is admirable. Example: he did an excellent job writing the code for almost sixteen Stories for the project OX 2.0 for Payroll. During the period of working on this project he showed the talent for simplifying complex problem. Example: Adrien recorded the Demo where he explained what should be done not only from Developer's perspective, but also he showed what should be verified by QA and how it should be verified.
Adrien has great communication skills. Example: he set up the meetings to clarify the questions, to discuss the requirements and functionality of features.
Working on the project OX 2.0 for Payroll Adrien demonstrated exceptional leadership. Example: To meet the deadline he delegated the part of the work to the Developers of our Team,  communicated clearly regarding the tasks, shared his knowledge and gave an expertise.
Adrien is a great team mate. He always finds the time to help other work mates with issues they have. Examples:
Adrien helped find the reason, why Automation Test for UK Payslip failed, he helped to fix the failure. 
He is always ready to review the code if other Developers don't have capacity or if they are on sick leave.
Adrien helps me, who is still new at WD, to learn about different topics.

I enjoy working with you, Adrien, and I admire your work ethic!",Team Award
